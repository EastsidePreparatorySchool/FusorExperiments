#Cockcroft-Walton Voltage Curves

##Goal
Understand how the high voltage setup behaves under high loads

##Prodecure

1) Connect to the Arduino via the Windows Bluetooth menu, and determine the port used by the Arduino. Using a terminal viewer program, give the "go" command to the Arduino.

2) Turn on variac

3) Increase variac voltage in intervals of 20 up to 140

4) Slowly turn the voltage back down to 0. Send the "stop" command to the Arduino.

5) Upload the output TXT file to Google Drive, and create a new `Experiment` object

##Results
