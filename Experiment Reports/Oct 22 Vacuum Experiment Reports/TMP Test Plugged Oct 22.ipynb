    "##Purpose:\n",
    "Gather more data on the pirani gauge display/voltage meter relationship. \n",
    "Determine whether we can control the needle valve opening, and document this.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gather all parts: \n",
    "\t- Cart\n",
    "\t- Pirani gauge display \n",
    "\t- Pirani gauge display transformer\n",
    "\t- Multimeter for back of Pirani gauge voltage\n",
    "\t- TMP (turbo molecular pump) transformer\n",
    "\t- Rough pump\n",
    "\t- KF flange\n",
    "2. Connect rough pump to turbo pump with KF flange\n",
    "3. Plug in the Pirani gauge display and transformer \n",
    "\t- Plug multimeter into the back of the Pirani gauge display (make sure to get positive and negative right)\n",
    "4. Plug in rough pump\n",
    "5. Ground the cart (or don't, but be sure to consider this)\n",
    "6. Plug in TMP transformer\n",
    "7. Plug in the TMP controller to its two ethernet ports and a computer running the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##What we wIll do:\n",
    "Pump down. This test does not have the deuterium injection assembly, the we plugged the hole where is usually is. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we will read out:\n",
    "The Pirani gauge reading (shortened to PG), the multimeter (connected to the pirani guage display, writen as V) reading, and the clamp meter reading (shortened to CM). The CM measures power draw to the TMP power supply. \n",
    "All readings are taken via video and significant points are noted below in notes and observations.\n"

    "##Notes and Observations:\n",
    "- TMP was turned on at .5 PG\n",
    "    - at this point the CM had some activity, see video\n",
    "- at .2 PG the TMP made acceleration sounds\n",
    "    - it then quickly went below .1 PG\n",
    "- at .07 PG the TMP slowed down\n",
    "    - this is better than previous runs by a small amount \n",
    "    \n",
